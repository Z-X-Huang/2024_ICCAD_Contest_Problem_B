## 2024 ICCAD Contest - Problem B: Power and Timing Optimization Using Multibit Flip-Flop

---
### 1 Introduction
In advanced semiconductor technology nodes, minimizing power and area is a key concern. A common technique is to replace single-bit flip-flops with multibit flip-flops, which saves area and simplifies power, ground, and clock routing.
This process is known as “multibit flip-flop banking.” However, banking can sometimes worsen timing for critical nets, potentially reducing overall optimization. To address this, “multibit flip-flop debanking”—splitting multibit flip-flops back into single-bit ones—is sometimes necessary.  
This contest simulates banking and debanking decisions in virtual designs, requiring contestants to optimize timing, power, and area for each testcase.
